There is a World
There are Cells in the world
The World is able to "Tick" to calculate the next generation of cells
The World only stores one generation
Cells have Coordinates
Coordinates have a non-discreet number of parts.
One "type" of Coordinate per world.
The coordinate type dictates the method of finding neighbours.
The World is able to return a Cell given a Coordinate.
Cells are of a type
There is a default (e.g. "Empty") type for cells.
Default cells will not be included in a world's cell count
Default cells will not be persisted between ticks.
There is a rule provider.
Only immediate neighbours are used in rules.
The rule provider defines the coordinate system
The rule provider defines all possible cell types
The rule provider constructs Cells from its definitions of coordinates and cell types
